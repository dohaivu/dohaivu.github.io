[The virtual Tug of War](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Tug-of-War)
> Protecting the target demands a change in mindset for how we approach security. Until now, the name of the game has been breach prevention, essentially ensuring the “good guys” stayed on the inside and the “bad guys” remained on the outside

> With new stealthy and sophisticated attacks being launched daily, most organizations are beginning to realize it is no longer a question of whether the company is breached or not; it is simply a matter of when. The mindset is moving from “breach prevention” to “breach acceptance.”   
This can be accomplished by deploying the following:

> - Encryption: When data is encrypted, it is only useful to people who hold the decryption key. Encryption can be deployed “end-to-end”, between datacenters, virtual machines, devices.
- Authentication: ensures only authorized personnel have access to specific bits of information. This granular form of access control exposes data only to the right people and eliminates exposing critical data to those that should not have it, thereby increasing security
