## Service Locator Pattern

Dependency Injection adopt push model. Another class is responsible for pushing(injecting) the dependencies into high level client classes at runtime

### Object composition
Dependency Injection will inject your dependencies at runtime. Your application must know when and where to compose objects before performing any task. Example: console app: __Main__, web app: __Global.asax__

### Object Lifetime
Each class will occupy a memory, so you have to determine when to inject objects and how long they will live

### Type of Injection
__Property Setter Injection__

__Method call Injection__

__Constructor Injection__

### Dependency Injection with Unity
Life cycle: Register, Resolve, Dispose

#### Register
Register dependency types that need to be instantiated and injected to a target object.

```csharp
UnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();
container.RegisterType<IBookRepository, BookRepository>();
```

#### Resolve
Instantiate object and dependency objects through type mapping.

```csharp
var controller = container.Resolve<BooksController>()
```

It will instantiate
