> I challenge myself to answer the following questions in everything I read:  

> - Has this taught me anything new and valuable? (If not, move on quickly)
- How can I apply insights from this article today? (Wait and I’ll forget)
- When have I applied the ideas from this post? Where have I not, but could have? (What was the difference?)

[Why Hiring Seasoned Sales Reps May Not Work](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/10/12/startup-sales-why-hiring-seasoned-reps-may-not-work)

[Instagram’s pivot into complexity](http://www.elezea.com/2013/06/instagram-video-complexity/)  
> Instagram’s core strength relied on a similar principle. It was just photos you could scroll through. Nothing more, nothing less. You could open Instagram for 10 seconds and check what’s new, or for 10 minutes and get lost in the universe of people’s lives. And you always knew what you were going to get: an endless stream of photos. Just keep scrolling.  

> Now there’s no way to tell if you’re going to see a photo or a video. When you do happen upon a video, you have to stop scrolling and wait for it to load. And if you happen to check Instagram during a meeting and forget to turn the sound off… well, awkward. 
 
> that it’s just the latest example of our obsession to add as many features as possible to products out of fear of losing traction. Instead of lateral shifts into additional functionality, I’d like to see more companies double down on the features they already have, and continuously improve the experience around those features.
