[Paul Graham: Some VCs Push For Large Rounds, Even When Startups Don't Need Them](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/06/27/paul-graham-some-vcs-push-for-large-rounds-even-when-startups-dont-need-them/)  
> Venture capitalists are getting smaller stakes in startups and that trend will increasingly continue. Venture investors are used to taking a 20% stake in Series A fundings. But that number is arbitrary and will inevitably go down further.  

> Today, VCs often push for larger first round financings even when they know the company doesn’t need it. Why? To make up for the “opportunity cost of taking a board seat,” Graham says.

[7 Months with TypeScript](http://tedpatrick.com/2013/06/25/7-months-with-typescript/)  
> TypeScript has been a joy to work with over the past 7 months. Having had experience with types/interfaces in ActionScript/ES4, I took to TypeScript very rapidly as it supported the structure I needed, yet maintained the elegant flexibility of JavaScript. In many ways I know our choice in using the compiler really moved our project forward in both delivery date and in code quality. I cannot say I have ever been a Microsoft fan but TypeScript has ‘softened’ me, it is easily one of the best web technologies to arrive in the past 3 years. I am looking forward to working on more projects with it and evolving with the language/compiler ongoing.
